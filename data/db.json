Like, even my silence had to be explained.\n\nQ: What does privacy look like for you now?\n\nA: It's less about hiding and more about having places where I don't perform — even emotionally.\n\nQ: How do you know when a song is finished?\n\nA: When the emotion stops asking for more. If I keep adding details, it's usually because I'm avoiding saying the simple truth.\n\nQ: Do you still write from the same place you started?\n\nA: The same place, but with better tools. I'm braver about letting things be ugly, or quiet.\n\nQ: What keeps you grounded?\n\nA: My family. And routines that are boring on purpose.\n\nQ: What are you chasing next?\n\nA: Space. More breathing room in the production, and more room in my life.",
